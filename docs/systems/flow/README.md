# Game Flow System

Documentation regarding the game's state transitions, command generation, and phase management.

> **Legacy Terminology Note:**
> Some documents in this section use the term "Action" to describe player moves.
> In the current implementation, these are implemented as `CommandDef` structures within the Command System.
> The high-level logic remains valid, but "Action" should be interpreted as "Command" or "Player Intent".
