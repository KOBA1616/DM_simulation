# Test Code Location

**Tests have been moved to the `tests/` directory at the project root.**

Please do not place new test code in this directory (`python/tests/`).
All Python test files should be located in `tests/` to maintain a consolidated test environment.

Existing verification scripts and `pytest` suites are now unified in `tests/`.
