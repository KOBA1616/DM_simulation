# Generated Tests Management Rules

This directory contains automated regression tests generated by the training loop and game engine. These tests are critical for ensuring that AI logic and edge case handling remain stable as the codebase evolves.

## Rules

1.  **Immutability**: Do not manually edit the scenario files in `scenarios/`. They are machine-generated. If a test case is wrong, fix the generator or the engine logic, then regenerate the case.
2.  **Source of Truth**: The `scenarios/` directory is the single source of truth for these tests. The `test_scenarios.py` script dynamically loads them.
3.  **Naming Convention**:
    *   Scenario files should follow `scenario_<ID_OR_HASH>.json` or `scenario_<DESCRIPTION>.json`.
    *   Example: `scenario_infinite_loop_bug.json`.
4.  **Format**: Scenarios are stored in JSON format containing:
    *   `initial_state`: A representation of the game state setup (decks, hands, zones).
    *   `action`: The action taken.
    *   `expected_outcome`: The assertions (e.g., `winner`, `zone_counts`, `error_raised`).
5.  **Performance**: These tests must be fast. Avoid full game simulations; focus on the specific turn or action step that caused the issue.

## Running Tests

These tests are automatically picked up by `pytest`:

```bash
pytest tests/generated/
```
